# sample-blog

## Overview
This was my very first attempt at making my very own blog post using only HTML and CSS. This sample blog site consists of a homepage, a sample blog post, and an About page simulating what I would put on a page that is not yet complete or ready for users' use.

## Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
## Instructions
To view the sample blog post in its entirety, clone the files and simply open the index.html file. From there, you can navigate to the other sample pages using the navigation bar at the top of the screen. Since there is no navigation bar on the About page, you will need to use the Back arrow on your browser.

*It'll be important that the files stay in the file hierarchy in which they are currently in so they are able to render properly
